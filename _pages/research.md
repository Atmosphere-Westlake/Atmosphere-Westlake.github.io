# Atmospheric Environment Research Group @ Westlake University

The air we breathe everyday consists of, in addition to the bulk of nitrogen and oxygen, a multitude of trace gases and particles. These trace compositions account for only a tiny fraction of air (from parts per million down to even parts per trillion), as compared to nitrogen and oxygen, but they play critical roles in Earthâ€™s energy balance, have huge impacts on the health of human, animals, and plants, and are closely associated with critical environmental issues that we are facing today, for example, air pollution, acid rain, ozone hole, and climate change.

Our research focuses on better understanding these atmospheric trace species, their properties and distributions, their sources and sinks, and their interactions with human and nature. In particular, we are interested in methane emissions and its budget, atmospheric oxidation power, light absorbing brown carbon, and regional air pollution. We develop novel modeling and analysis tools to interpret big environmental data collected from multiple platforms (e.g., satellite, aircraft, surface networks), and gain insight into mechanisms that regulate key atmospheric species across spatial and temporal scales. Through our research, we aspire to bridges the knowledge gap in pressing environmental issues and inform scientific information to policy makers and the public.
