My current research involves using multi-platform observations to improve our understanding about the global budget of atmospheric methane (CH4), a potent greenhouse gas.

* Inverse analysis of anthropogenic and natural emissions of methane using satellite and ground-based observations
* Monitor global hydroxyl radical concentration with satelllite observations of atmospheric methane 
* Identification of global oil&gas methane emission hotspot
